This is an SQL project.\
As part of a class project, I led the migration of departmental databases from local servers to a computational cloud platform, focusing on data security and accessibility.\
Additionally, the project involved creating Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams to visualize database structures and executing advanced SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis.
