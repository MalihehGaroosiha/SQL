This is a SQL project.\
In this project, I have used reverse engineering to load the script of a database into SQLenvinonment to create the database structure. After creating the ER diagram, I exported the database to SQL format.\
In Step 2, I attempted to retrieve tables based on stakeholder questions. The relational database contains 5 tables.
